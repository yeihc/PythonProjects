# Upgrading from Twitter v1.1 to Twitter v2

On August 18, 2022, we discovered that **new** Twitter developer accounts cannot access the Twitter version 1.1 APIs on which we based Chapter 12, Data Mining Twitter, and two case studies in Chapter 16, Big Data: Hadoop, Spark, NoSQL and IoT. 

Twitter users who already had Twitter developer accounts can still access the Twitter version 1.1 APIs, but most students and some instructors will not fall into this category.
 
We’ve already rewritten Chapter 12 to the Twitter version 2 APIs and will be rewriting the two Twitter-based Chapter 16 case studies soon. 

The updated chapter is posted on the book's webpage:

Once completed, we’ll post updated versions of the Chapter 16 Twitter-based case studies.
